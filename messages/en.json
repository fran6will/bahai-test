    "transcendentGodText": "For Bahá'ís, God is the creative source of all existence. This divine Reality, imperceptible and invisible, transcends human intelligence and understanding: It encompasses all things and therefore cannot itself be encompassed. Any conception we may have of the Divine is limited by our material existence. The qualities we attribute to God help us shape our understanding of Reality, but the true nature of this Supreme Essence is unknowable.",
    "progressiveRevelationTitle": "A progressively unfolding Revelation",
    "progressiveRevelationText1": "This conception of the divine explains why different traditions have developed various names and understandings of one same divine Reality: God, Allah, Yahweh, the Tao, the Manitou, the Heavenly Father, and so on. From this perspective, the different religions are not contradictory constructions, but rather responses adapted to the specific needs of the societies that received them. Abraham, Krishna, Zoroaster, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, and more recently Bahá'u'lláh, the Founder of the Bahá'í Faith, are regarded, among others, as Messengers emanating from the same divine Source, each bringing spiritual teachings suited to the time and context in which they appear.",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "What is the demographic makeup of the Bahá'í community of Montreal?",
    "faq1Answer": "The community is as diverse as the population of Montreal itself, both in terms of age and ethnic background. You will find Bahá'ís with cultural roots in many parts of the world. As the religion originated in Persia, there is a particularly large number of Bahá'ís of Iranian origin. The ongoing persecution of Bahá'ís by the Iranian government has led many believers to resettle around the world, including here in Montreal.",
    "faq2Question": "How many Bahá'ís are there in Montreal, in Canada, and around the world?",
    "faq2Answer": "The Bahá'í Faith has more than five million members worldwide. It is established in over 100,000 localities, in virtually every country and territory of the world. In Canada, there are more than 30,000 members from diverse backgrounds living in over 1,200 localities. In Montreal specifically, there are approximately 400 Bahá'ís.",
    "faq2Link": "To learn more:",
    "faq3Question": "Who leads the Bahá'í community of Montreal?",
    "faq3Answer": "The Bahá'í Faith has no clergy. This means that no intermediary stands between an individual and their spiritual search. Community decisions are made collectively through consultation. The Faith does, however, have an administrative system at the international, national, and local levels. As in most cities around the world, Montreal has its own local administrative council. Known as the Local Spiritual Assembly, this institution is made up of nine members who are elected each year in a non-partisan manner by the Bahá'ís of the city.",
    "faq4Question": "Is there a church in Montreal?",
    "faq4Answer": " There is no church in the Bahá'í Faith. Activities are mainly organized at the neighbourhood level and take place in informal settings such as homes, parks, or community centres. It is not uncommon to attend a gathering in someone's home, take part in a youth group at a community centre, or have a meaningful conversation in a café. Although there is no church, the Bahá'í Faith does have temples (called \"Houses of Worship\") that are open to all for prayer and meditation. The House of Worship closest to Montreal is located in Wilmette, Illinois, near Chicago.",
    "faq5Question": "How does one become a Bahá'í?",
    "faq5Answer": "To be a Bahá'í simply means to recognize Bahá'u'lláh as the Messenger of God for our time and to strive to follow His laws and teachings. There is no formal process or ritual required to become a Bahá'í. If you recognize Bahá'u'lláh and seek to live according to His teachings, then you are a Bahá'í. That said, people generally inform the local administrative council (called the Local Spiritual Assembly) of their faith, so that they can participate fully in community activities and take part in the administrative life of the community.",
    "faq6Question": "How can I take part in activities in Montreal?",
    "faq6Answer": "Activities take place throughout the city. If you know a Bahá'í in your neighbourhood, you can ask them for more information. Otherwise, you can contact the Local Spiritual Assembly, which can put you in touch with a Bahá'í near you.",
    "faq7Question": "What is the connection between Montreal and the history of the Bahá'í Faith?",
    "faq7Answer": "Montreal holds a unique place in Bahá'í history. It is the only city in Canada visited by 'Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of Bahá'u'lláh, during His journey to North America in 1912. His visit and stay at the Bahá'í Shrine of Montreal make it a sacred and historically significant place.",
    "faq8Question": "Which languages are used in Bahá'í activities in Montreal?",
    "faq8Answer": "Bahá'í activities in Montreal are conducted mainly in French and English. Many gatherings are bilingual, and the community strives to be linguistically inclusive, reflecting the city's diversity.",
